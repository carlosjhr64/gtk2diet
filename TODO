TODO

	MMA... you don't actually need to read the file each time
		But how?

DONE

	5 stages works better than 6.
	append like
		weight date
	instead of
		# date
		weight

	initial MMA is wrong
		there's 2 paths to get mma, that's a problem.


	Usability of the app menu items?
	Idiot proofing... go over all user entries, ensure correct format.
